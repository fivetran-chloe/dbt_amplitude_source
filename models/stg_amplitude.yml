        description: >
          Event properties are attributes of the events your users fire, and which you then send to Amplitude. Each event will have its own set of event properties. The nature of these properties depends on both the type of product you have, and the specific information you're most interested in discovering. For instance, if Swipe is an event you're tracking, the event property Direction could have the values Left or Right.
          Some example event properties are description, category, type, duration, level, percent completed, count, source, status, number, lives, authenticated, error number, rank, action, and mode.

          Amplitude timestamp (UTC) which is the client_event_time adjusted by the

          client_upload_time) 2015-08-10T12:00:00.000000 We use this timestamp to
          organize events on Amplitude charts. Note: If the difference between
          server_received_time and client_upload_time is less than 60 seconds, the
          event_time will not be adjusted and will equal the client_event_time

          Amplitude uses a combination of three different methods to identify your users: device IDs, Amplitude ID, and user IDs. The first comes directly from your users' devices, while the second is an ID that Amplitude automatically creates once it has enough information to conclusively identify a unique user. The user ID, however, is something you'd set up.
          In Amplitude, a user ID is a unique identifier applied to individual users. Using them is optional, but recommended: your product should set a user ID once a user has created an account, logged in, or is otherwise identified in your product.
          Amplitude can use a user ID to reconcile events across multiple devices under the same user ID. Additionally, a user's event data will be merged on the backend so that all anonymous events prior to the assignment of a user ID will be connected to the correct user. For this reason, you can wait to assign user IDs if that makes sense for your product. Conversely, this is also why you should not set user IDs for anonymous users.
          Once set, user IDs in Amplitude cannot be changed.Once set, user IDs in Amplitude cannot be changed.
